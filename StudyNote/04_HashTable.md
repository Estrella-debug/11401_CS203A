# Hash Table Notes

## Description
**Hash Table (or Hash Map):**
- A data structure that stores key-value pairs using an underlying array (or list of buckets).
- It uses a hash function to compute an index (a bucket location) from a given key.
- This mapping enables average constant-time complexity (O(1)) for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
- Hash tables are ideal for fast data retrieval due to this efficiency.
